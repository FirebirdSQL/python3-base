signal - Callback system based on Signals and Slots, and "Delphi events"
########################################################################

Overview
========

This module provides two callback mechanisms: one based on signals and slots similar to Qt
signal/slot, and second based on optional method delegation similar to events in Delphi.

In both cases, the callback callables could be functions, instance or class methods,
partials and lambda functions. The `inspect` module is used to define the signature for
callbacks, and to validate that only compatible callables are assigned.

.. important::

   All type annotations in signatures are significant, so callbacks must have exactly the
   same annotations as signatures used by signals or events. The sole exception are excess
   keyword  arguments with default values defined on connected callable.

.. tip::

   You may use `functools.partial` to adapt callable with different signatures. However,
   you can "mask" only keyword arguments (without default) and leading positional arguments
   (as any positional argument binded by name will not mask-out parameter from signature
   introspection).

Signals and Slots
-----------------

Signals and slots are suitable for 1:N notification schemes. The `Signal` works as a point
to which one or more Slots could be connected. When `Signal` is "emitted", all connected
slots are called (executed). It's possible to pass parameters to slot callables, but any
value returned by slot callable is ignored. The Signal contructor takes `inspect.Signature`
argument that defines the required signature that callables (slots) must have to connect
to this signal.

This mechanism is provided in two forms:

- The `Signal` class to create signal instances for direct use.
- The `signal` decorator to define signals on classes. This decorator works like builtin
  `property` (without setter and deleter), where the 'getter' method is used only to define
  the signature required for slots.

**Example:**

.. code-block::

    class Emitor:
        def __init__(self, name: str):
            self.name = name
        def showtime(self):
            self.signal_a(self, 'They Live!', 42)
        @signal
        def signal_a(self, source: Emitor, msg: str, value: int) -> None:
            "Documentation for signal"

    class Receptor:
        def __init__(self, name: str):
            self.name = name
        def on_signal_a(self, source: Emitor, msg: str, value: int) -> None:
            print(f"{self.name} received signal from {source.name} ({msg=}, {value=})")
        @classmethod
        def cls_on_signal_a(cls, source: Emitor, msg: str, value: int) -> None:
            print(f"{cls.__name__} received signal from {source.name} ({msg=}, {value=})")

    def on_signal_a(source: Emitor, msg: str, value: int):
        print(f"Function 'on_signal_a' received signal from {source.name} ({msg=}, {value=})")

    e1 = Emitor('e1')
    e2 = Emitor('e2')
    r1 = Receptor('r1')
    r2 = Receptor('r2')
    #
    e1.signal_a.connect(r1.on_signal_a)
    e1.signal_a.connect(r2.on_signal_a)
    e1.signal_a.connect(r1.cls_on_signal_a)
    e2.signal_a.connect(on_signal_a)
    e2.signal_a.connect(r2.on_signal_a)
    #
    e1.showtime()
    e2.showtime()

|

**Output from sample code**::

    r1 received signal from e1 (msg='They Live!', value=42)
    r2 received signal from e1 (msg='They Live!', value=42)
    Receptor received signal from e1 (msg='They Live!', value=42)
    Function 'on_signal_a' received signal from e2 (msg='They Live!', value=42)
    r2 received signal from e2 (msg='They Live!', value=42)


Events
------

Events are suitable for optional callbacks that delegate some functionality to other class
or function.

The 'event' works as a point to which one 'slot' could be connected. The event itself
acts as callable, that executes the connected slot (if assigned). Events may have parameters
and return values. Events could be defined only on classes using `eventsocket` decorator,
that works like builtin `property` (without deleter), where the 'getter' method is used only
to define the signature required for slot, and 'setter' is used to assign the callable.
To disconnect the callable from event, simply assign None to the event.

**Example:**

.. code-block::

    class Component:
        def __init__(self, name: str):
            self.name = name
        @eventsocket
        def on_init(self, source: Component, arg: str) -> bool:
            "Documentation for event"
        @eventsocket
        def on_exit(self, source: Component) -> None:
            "Documentation for event"
        def showtime(self) -> None:
            print(f"{self.name}.on_init handler is {'SET' if self.on_init.is_set() else 'NOT SET'}")
            print(f"{self.name}.on_exit handler is {'SET' if self.on_exit.is_set() else 'NOT SET'}")
            print("Event handler returned", self.on_init(self, 'argument'))
            print(f"{self.name} does something...")
            self.on_exit(self)

    class Container:
        def __init__(self):
            self.c1 = Component('C1')
            self.c1.on_init = self.event_init
            self.c2 = Component('C2')
            self.c2.on_init = self.event_init
            self.c2.on_exit = self.event_exit
            self.c3 = Component('C3')
            self.c3.on_exit = self.event_exit
        def event_init(self, source: Component, arg: str) -> bool:
            print(f"Handlig {source.name}.on_init({arg=})")
            return source is self.c2
        def event_exit(self, source: Component) -> None:
            print(f"Handlig {source.name}.on_exit()")
        def showtime(self) -> None:
            self.c1.showtime()
            self.c2.showtime()
            self.c3.showtime()

    cn = Container()
    cn.showtime()

**Output from sample code**::

    C1.on_init handler is SET
    C1.on_exit handler is NOT SET
    Handlig C1.on_init(arg='argument')
    Event handler returned False
    C1 does something...
    C2.on_init handler is SET
    C2.on_exit handler is SET
    Handlig C2.on_init(arg='argument')
    Event handler returned True
    C2 does something...
    Handlig C2.on_exit()
    C3.on_init handler is NOT SET
    C3.on_exit handler is SET
    Event handler returned None
    C3 does something...
    Handlig C3.on_exit()
