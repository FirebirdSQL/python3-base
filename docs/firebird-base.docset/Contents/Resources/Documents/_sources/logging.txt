logging - Context-based logging
###############################

Overview
========

This module provides context-based logging system built on top of standard `logging` module.

The context-based logging:

1. Adds context information into `~logging.LogRecord`, that could be used in logging message.
2. Adds support for f-string message format.
3. Allows assignment of loggers to specific contexts.

The logging context
-------------------
The logging context is defined as combination of `topic`, `agent` and `context` string values.

The `agent` is typically an unit of code that works in specific execution contexts. For
example a code that process client request in web application (where request is the context),
or executes SQL command (the context could be a database connection, or transaction).
The `topic` is optional. It could be any string value that can be used as secondary context.

Agent and Context identification
--------------------------------
Agents and contexts could be identified by string value, or by any object (i.e. you can use
the object that implement the agent or context). If object is used, the ID could be
provided as `logging_id` attribute, `__name__` attribute or by `__str__()` return value.

A `LoggingIdMixin` class could be used to add `logging_id` support to any class.

The LoggingManager
------------------
The `LoggingManager` class maintains a set of bindings between `~logging.Logger` objects and
combination of `agent`, `context` and `topic` specifications. It's possible to bind loggers
to exact combination of values, or whole sets of values using `.ANY` sentinel. It means that
is possible to assign specific `~logging.Logger` to log messages for particular agent in
any context, or any agent operating in specific context etc.

To log `agent` activities, use a logger returned by `.get_logger()` function/method.

Example
-------

The following program is an example of small but complex enough code that you can use to experiment with contextual logging options. Parts relevant to logging are highlighted in the code by embedded comments. The program is very simple simulation of virtual "human" agents that can change their mood during mutual interaction.
