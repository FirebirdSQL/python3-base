collections - Various collection types
######################################

Overview
========

This module provides data structures that behave much like builtin `list` and `dict` types,
but with direct support of operations that can use structured data stored in container, and
which would normally require utilization of `operator`, `functools` or other means.

All containers provide next operations:

* `filter` and `filterfalse` that return generator that yields items for which `expr` is
  evaluated as True (or False).
* `find` that returns first item for which `expr` is evaluated as True, or default.
* `contains` that returns True if there is any item for which `expr` is evaluated as True.
* `occurrence` that returns number of items for which `expr` is evaluated as True.
* `all` and `any` that return True if `expr` is evaluated as True for all or any list element(s).
* `report` that returns generator that yields data produced by expression(s) evaluated on
  list items.

Individual collection types provide additional operations like splitting and extracting
based on expression etc.

Expressions used by these methods could be strings that contain Python expression
referencing the collection item(s), or lambda functions.
